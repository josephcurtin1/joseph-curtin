<h1>This is a thing that has words</h1>
<p>Phishing, flaming, and spamming are 3 different things. Phishing is the practice of sending emails purporting to be from trustworthy companies to convince individuals to reveal their personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. Flaming is to attack someone verbally online, and spamming is sending the same message on the Internet repeatedly.

While these things are very different, they do have their similarities. Phishing, flaming, and spamming are all examples of how computers, as well as the internet, should not be used. Phishing for personal information can lead to illegal activity, such as stalking or the stealing of credit card information. Flaming somebody on the internet can cause the person receiving the insults to become depressed or even suicidal in some cases. Spamming is using the internet to advertise their product without paying for it, and often phishing for information in the process.</p>
